## CAPACITY

Capacity is a location based app that uses crowd sourced reviews to allow users the ability to see in real time how busy a location is. With a dynamic heatmap layered over establishments, we are giving people the ability to better plan their trips whether it's an afternoon at the grocery store, or a night out in an unfamiliar city where they'd like to get a taste of the local nightlife. 

In this way Capacity is a multifaceted app. It can be either used during a global pandemic giving users a tool to help them avoid large crowds when possible, or it can be used in a post-Covid world where human interactions will be even more important.
